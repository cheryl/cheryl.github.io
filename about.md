I'm interested in a lot of craft. Craft, including coding, knitting, crochet, digital painting, comics, breadmaking, cake baking, coding, traditional painting, coding... There is just so much beauty out there, I can't deny the stamp of my Creator.

Wellanyway, instead of managing five million craft blogs and forgetting about each one as I move on to the next fascinating craft, I figured I should start a single blog where it all ends up and we can sort it out one day.
Like those 1990s web sites that call themselves "X's website" with wildly differing sections, only hopefully mine has a little less unnecessary-moving-gif and sparkly unicorn.
And is less rambly.

And at worst, if it fails both of those, at least I can say I deployed it within 20 minutes. I did say coding, didn't I?
This is built on Semantic.gs grid framework which I edited a bit to make it fluid. I hope you enjoy using, forking, whatevering this theme as much as I did making it.
