I found someone else's art online. Original lineart before mypaint/gimp, scrambling through a dying printer and being merrily coloured in by me and a two-year-old is [here](http://fc01.deviantart.net/fs71/i/2014/074/4/6/frozen___elsa_and_anna_by_verkoka-d7a98t5.jpg).

I'm not a Frozen fan - the recipient is - but I do appreciate a good pun. The best thing was that E was able to help me make this card. Her fine motor skills are getting so good.
