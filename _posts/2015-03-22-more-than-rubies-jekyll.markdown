I don't know the first thing about Ruby, other than that my nerdy friends all say it's awesome, and junethack sits on sinatra ruby.
What am I doing wading through Rakefile and heroku?
Why aren't I sticking to good old unlovely but familiar php?

I updated jekyll.

When I set it up a couple nights ago, I freely confess I googled jekyll heroku and cloned someone else's site that was already set up to deploy to heroku, so I could get started on a post and not worry about all that *learning*.
Tonight I felt a little guilty (and rich in free time) so I redid it manually starting with 'gem install jekyll' and ending with jekyll 2.5.3, a slightly more hacked together server and yet, more or less the same functionality as yesterday (yay!).

It's been helpful. I'm no longer terrified of the Gemfile.
Don't quiz me on anything else, though. I'm sure it's magic.

Anyway, in case you didn't guess, learning's why we're playing with ruby, even though we suck at it.
