Start from the back cover, with the would-be spine facing you.

The basic idea is pierce all the stations at least twice, once to link to the edge and once to link to the next station, and more if you make mistakes (frequently!).

You're supposed to stitch the board and the first sheet in one row using two passes, but I will refer to this as second row board and second row sheet.

The first row has only a board. No stitching to see here, unless you want to go over once for decorative effect...like I did, unintentionally!
The second row has a board and a sheet, but no previous stitch to kettle to. Here you are creating the first stitch and anchoring the stack to the board.
The third is your true coptic stitch. Once you get to this point, you can repeat until you've done the whole stack.
The last is your front cover.

The stitch runs something like this:

1. Pierce the hole of the first station of your new sheet. 1st/2nd row pierce the board.
2. Take note if the needle is facing up or down as it goes through. Whichever way it is facing should be flipped open as the 'working side'. (1st/2nd row ignore)
3. With your non-sewing hand, take the previous sheet and open it halfway.
If your working side had your sheet closed, you will now be holding two sheets; otherwise, the new sheet should dangle down under tension and you are holding one sheet. (1st/2nd row ignore)
4. With your sewing hand, poke your needle between the previous kettle stitches. (1st/2nd row ignore)
5. Bring the thread around the whole stitch of the previous sheet, whole stitch of this station (second row sheet - anchoring the stack!), or just the board (1st row/second row board).
6. Pull it back to your working side. 1st row ignore.
7. Encircle the newly created stitch with your thread. 1st row ignore.
8. 2nd row pierce the hole on the new sheet. Repeat steps 2, 5-7, then 8.
9. Flip your sheet to the non-working side and pierce the hole again. 1st row ignore.
10. Pierce the hole of the next station using a horizontal/running stitch.
11. Repeat steps 2-10.

Encircling in my case refers to passing the needle under an edge stitch towards one direction, and then threading it around following the same direction on the other side.
This should create a loose lock (not necessarily a knot). If it doesn't (eg end stitch) I will add one, or if it has no other possible anchors (eg second row board) an actual knot.
