Remember that single sheet coptic book I was totally regretting taking on? Turns out I have a habit of cold feet.
It took me fully a week to do anything about the stack of sheets that purported to be the book content.


Advice on /r/bookbinding said to either mount the sheets and bind the mounted media, or use book tape. I opted for book tape, but I had done an earlier test of a small book using plain printer paper and sewing thread seemed to work fine.
Some of the holes got a little loose over time, but considering it was promptly given to a 2-year-old on completion, I think the stitching held up fairly well.

about 2/3 of the sheets were printer paper weight. Some were lighter and some was cardstock.

Book boards. Covered using wheat paste, as mentioned in my earlier post. Waited a few days for it to dry under pressure with much pleasure that I was being so patient, only to realise when it came time to punch the holes that I had not pasted on the inside covers...oops. We think we are so clever but we are only newbies at the craft God has been at so long.

Cut some matching cardstock and pasted on the inside covers with wheat paste.Let that dry for a few days (with less arrogance!).

21 stitching stations of A5 sheets. Woo! This is quite a lot. Most tutorials on the internet call for 5-8 stations and some commercial books I peeked at had about 10 for larger signatures. Having done another test book using a whopping 29 stations I think 21 is formidable but not impossible. Once you get into the rhythm of the stitching it goes by pretty quickly.
I couldn't justify buying an awl.  Okay, so it's only $1 on Ebay but the time spent searching + stewarding yet another implement in my overly grown craft stash I felt could be better used elsewhere. I used the sharp point of a compass instead.

I punched the paper first, and then centred the same number of holes on the board.  I made the board holes a little further in than the paper.

I started at the upper edge of the back cover and stitched just the cover by itself (not the back cover and the last page together - I never did figure out how that was supposed to work). I held the cover outside down, with the inside facing up.

for the cover this was needle starting from beneath, pointing upward through the board. I first looped around the edge of the board and tied a tight knot, then moved to the next station using a running stitch through the side closest to me. At the next station I would loop around again with the needle starting above, pointing downward, and from there move to the next station through the side furthest away.

When I got to the end of the row I had finished the stitching on the inside cover (ie closest to me) and could move on to the sheets, but the outside wasn't complete. This would happen at the end of every row, so I decided to add a tiny bit of bulk and stitch the back and front again, leaving the last station with two threads running through it on one side and one on the other. I was to discover the same thing would regularly happen on the opposite end, on the opposite side of the sheet. I don't suppose my friend will really mind.

After that last extra double stitch, you 'kettle-lock' the thread around the edge of the last stitch on the board which in this case has no other sheet behind it so you're essentially tying a thumb knot. This is to prevent the thread from the last stitch moving up and down along the stitch between the hole and the edge of the board, which will cause the whole stack to slide around.

Holding the new sheet to exactly cover the equivalent holes of the just-completed row, decide if you're going to start needle up or needle down - depending if you have an odd or even number of stations. Then push the needle through as if you were in the middle of the row (ie ignore the fact that there's thread and a loose sheet of paper flying everywhere).

Thread through the previous knot and then lock your new thread to the edge of the sheet as you repeat that initial stitch (the extra double stitch). The sheet should now dangle freely but if you put tension on the thread it will only rotate tightly around the other sheet, not swing.

Work your way across the stations using a running stitch. Upon piercing through a station for the first time, immediately thread through the loop around the board's edge, encircle the stitch on the new sheet you just made by doing so, and then flip to the opposite side of the new sheet and go through the station again.
This brings you back to the alternate side of the running stitch, so rinse and repeat from the opposite side of the new sheet to whatever you just did.

It's the next sheet that is a true coptic stitch. The board row was just loops, and the first new sheet had no previous stitch so you couldn't really anchor it to anything.

When you get to the end of your first sheet, do the extra double stitch to finish the pattern and then lock your thread to the just-completed stitch. Repeat with your new sheet as for your first, with a difference. After piercing a station for the first time, whichever way the needle is facing will be the 'kettle side' of the sheet for the kettle of your stitch and should be face up.
Regardless if the new sheet is 'open' or 'closed', now take the previous sheet and open it halfway.
Poking the needle between the previous kettle stitches, bring the thread around the whole stitch of the previous sheet.
Pull it back through to your kettle side. Encircle the newly created stitch with thread and then flip your sheet to the non-kettle side and enter the station again.

If this is your first sheet, you won't have a previous sheet, just a board.
Instead, thread through the loop on the board, encircle your just-created stitch, and loop right through the board as if you were doing the first row again. When you get back to your encircled stitch, position your sheet tightly where you want it to be, encircle the entire stitch a second time and then continue with your kettle.
The first encircling ensures your new sheet stays secure to its thread, and the second, after the repeated board loop, ensures that the whole stack doesn't slide around on the loop.
