This is the 'Shepherding the heart' conference by Tedd and Margy Tripp.  It's not a "craft" conference - unless you count mothercraft! I think I knew at least half of what was said already through their books but that was so long ago that it was a very fresh and new reminder.  It was also helpful to hear these things said in different ways, with such vivid and wonderful illustrations that it will be hard to remember the anecdote and not also the lesson.

Quick list of notes:

  - formative instruction: 3-generational view in Deut 6, and a view of the kingdom and the glory of God.
  - "the heart" - notebook!
  - "reaping process" of corrective instruction.

The reason I'm writing this post here is because as my lovely sister and I were eating lunch with a couple of our friends, she noticed Tedd and Margy sitting by themselves at the next table, and suggested we crash their party. We did! I'm really not the type to go up to speakers at conferences but I'm so glad she suggested it. (I'm getting to it.)
It turns out Margy is really arty and loves flowers, and most recently does watercolours and stained glass art. She even has her own stained glass workshop. She has no green thumbs though, so Tedd is the gardener for her.

I no longer feel as strongly the twinge of jealousy that comes so surely when I see other people doing their art well. Strange admission, yet timely now as any other time. Part of it must surely be my coming to realise that nothing I do is ex nihilo, and even what I do do was crafted, planned and invented by God and given me in small part out of much graciousnes. Lord, help me see you in every brush stroke instead of myself.
