Having made three (3) measly books I volunteered to make a hand bound book as a present for a friend on behalf of other friends, which turns out to have been more complicated/awkward than I'd like.

For one, it's all single sheets, not signatures, and for another there is apparently no source of what Americans call chipboard within 150ks of my house. Also known as paperboard or book board, or the hard board at the backs of large pads of paper, if it's about 2mm thick. Surprisingly difficult to explain.

As a beginning bookbinder I also had no permanent materials, other than what one might expect from having other textile hobbies, such as needles, thread, paper, cloth and glue. So in the name of this special present I have purchased book repair tape and spent long hours poring over bookbinding books.

I also had no bookcloth. Googled tutorials suggested fusible interfacing, which I have none of either. I doubted I was going to find any at a bearable price within the timeframe. So after more googling I found tutorials for making my own...from *flour*. (Great! I have lots of flour! Whole rye or high grade wheat? I went with the high grade.) Turns out making bookcloth by hand is papier mache-ing a flat sheet of cloth.

I suppose this is not all bad. It is mostly good. I think I just bit off more than I usually think I can chew for a new hobby. I hope I'm still interested in the craft by the time I'm done!
